  - Change the log file name of 'mlcnt.pl'

    Variable name : $STACKF1 / $STACKF2
       The log file name of the 'mlcnt.pl'. it is used by 'mlcnt.pl'
       itself.
             $STACKF1 : Current log file name
             $STACKF2 : Previous log file name (Back up)

       longest prefix length.

2.2 How to use?

  'mlcnt.pl' which is executed by cron counts a number of prefixes and
  it can be showing a status using WWW. This section explains a example.
  it counts a number of prefixes for each prefix lengths in every 15
  minutes.

  Firstly, you should execute BGPView. Before that, you should configure
  'PREFIXOUT' parameter as BGPView output a prefix log.

  The log file, it is specified by 'PREFIXOUT' parameter, is refreshed
  by 'USR1' signal to BGPView. the previous log file is renamed for
  a back up log file. (See, BGPView's readme file) This document recommend
  that 'mlcnt.pl' uses the back up log file for counting.
  If you use the back up log file for counting, then you should configure
  '$LOGFILE' will be set the back up log file name, and configure 
  following for cron. 

  0-59/15 * * * * kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/bgpview.pid`;/usr/local/bin/mlcnt.pl
