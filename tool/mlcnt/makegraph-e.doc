1. Overview

  This is a tool set for drawing a graph which describes a number of
  received prefixes using log file of the 'mlcnt.pl'.
  the 'mlcnt.pl' makes only HTML file including numbers. This tool
  improves it.

2. Prerequisite

  'makegraph.pl' needs the following applications. However, when the
  gnuplot supports 'GIF' terminal, this does not need 'ppmtogif' if
  you change a little bit in function 'drawgnuplot' in 'makegraph.pl'.

    - gnuplot	: This is a tool for drawing a graph.
    - ppmtogif	: This is a converter from pbm to gif.

  Please install above applications before installing this tool.

3. Usage

3.1 Parameter Configuration in 'makegraph.pl'

  Please configure following parameters in 'makegraph.pl' as you like.

  - Change the path for perl

    Change the path name for perl in 1st line.

  - Change the path for gnuplot

    Variable name : $GNUPLOT
       The full path name of 'gnuplot'

  - Change the path for ppmtogif

    Variable name : $PPMTOGIF
       The full path name of 'ppmtogif'

  - Change the log file name of 'mlcnt.pl'

    Variable name : $MLCNTLOG
       The full path name of the log file of 'mlcnt.pl' 

  - Change the directory name of data

    Variable name : $DATADIR
       The directory name of temporally data for 'makegraph.pl'

  - Change the file name of output graphic file

    Variable name : $OUTGIF
       It is specified the file name of outputting graphic file
       by full path name. 

  - Specifying drawing prefix length

    Variable name : @updatepl / @withdrawpl
       '@updatepl' is specified the prefix length of update, and
       '@withdrawpl' is specified the prefix length of withdrawn.
       If you don't need to draw the withdraw data, then you should
       configure '@withdrawpl=();'


2.2 How to use?

  'makegraph.pl' can draw specific time range of the number of 
  update/withdraw prefixes, and it can draw the interactive graphs
  if it synchronize with 'mlcnt.pl'.

  If you make a file such as 'makegraph1.pl' and 'makegraph2.pl' by
  copying 'makegraph.pl', then it can draw the graph which is specified
  prefix length.
  Generally, the number of withdraw is less than the number of update.
  Therefore, in my recommendation, the withdraw graph and the update
  graph should be separate to 2 other graphs.
